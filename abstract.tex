Supporting the smooth movement of mobile clients is vitally important when offloading services on the edge computing platform. Interruption-free client mobility demands seamless migration of the offloading service to nearby edge servers.
However, fast migration of offloading services across edge servers in a WAN environment poses significant challenges to the handoff service design. 
In this paper, we present a novel service handoff system which seamlessly migrates offloading services to the nearest edge server, while the mobile client is moving. 
Service handoff is achieved via container migration. 
We identify an important performance problem during Docker container migration.
Based on our systematic study of container layer management and image stacking,
we propose a migration method which leverages the layered storage system to reduce file system synchronization overhead, without dependence on the distributed file system. 
We implement a prototype system and conduct experiments using real world product applications.
Evaluation results reveal that compared to state-of-the-art service handoff systems designed for edge computing platforms, our system reduces the total duration of service handoff time by 
$80\%$($56\%$) with network bandwidth $5$Mbps($20$Mbps).



% Edge computing platform provides low end-to-end latency by offloading mobile device's resource-intensive processing to the edge servers.
% Edge server provides low end-to-end latency of resource-intensive application by providing offloading services for its nearby mobile clients.
% Offloading mobile device's workloads to its nearby edge server provides high responsive user experiences for the client. 

% Offloading service provided by edge servers should support the free mobility of the mobile clients. 
% While edge computing platform promises to provide low end-to-end latency services to its nearby mobile clients, 
% the support of client mobility has great impacts on the service performance. 



% Specifically, we aim to reduce the total duration of migration instead of the downtime.
